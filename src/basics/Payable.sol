 * - Regular functions: Can't receive money
 * - Payable functions: Can receive ETH
 * 
 * Visual Flow of ETH:
 * 
 *    User/Contract        Smart Contract
 *    [1 ETH] üí∞     ‚Üí    üì¶ [Balance]
 *                   payable
 * 
 * Function Types:
 * +------------------+-------------------+
 * |     Payable      |    Non-Payable   |
 * +------------------+-------------------+
 * | Can receive ETH  | Can't receive ETH |
 * | üí∞ Enabled      | üö´ Disabled      |

/*
 * PAYABLE BEST PRACTICES:
 * 
 * 1. Security:
 *    - Always check for successful transfers
 *    - Use require() after ETH transfers
 *    - Consider reentrancy attacks
 * 
 * 2. Design:
 *    - Mark functions payable only if needed
 *    - Keep track of deposits/withdrawals
 *    - Consider using events for transfers
 * 
 * 3. Gas Efficiency:
 *    - Use .call() for transfers (recommended)
 *    - Avoid .transfer() and .send() (legacy)
 * 
 * Common Patterns:
 * - Deposit/Withdraw pattern
 * - Pull over Push payments
 * - Emergency withdrawal
