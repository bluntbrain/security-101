 * 
 * How Contract Receives ETH:
 * 
 *                  Incoming Transaction
 *                         ‚¨áÔ∏è
 *              Has ETH been sent?
 *            /                    \
 *          Yes                    No
 *          /                        \
 *    Is msg.data empty?         fallback()
 *    /              \
 * Yes              No
 * /                  \
 * receive()      fallback()
 * 
 * Visual Function Selection:
 * +------------------+------------------+------------------+
 * | Condition        | msg.data empty?  | Function Called  |
 * +------------------+------------------+------------------+
 * | Sending ETH      |       ‚úÖ        | receive()        |
 * | Sending ETH      |       ‚ùå        | fallback()       |
 * | No ETH          |     Either       | fallback()       |

/*
 * COMMON USE CASES:
 * 
 * receive():
 * - Accept ETH payments
 * - Simple ETH transfers
 * - No additional logic needed
 * 
 * fallback():
 * - Handle unknown function calls
 * - Accept ETH with data
 * - Custom function forwarding
 * 
 * Visual Example of Calls:
 * 
 * 1. Regular ETH Transfer:
 * send 1 ETH ‚Üí receive()
 * 
 * 2. ETH + Data Transfer:
 * send 1 ETH + data ‚Üí fallback()
 * 
 * 3. Unknown Function:
 * call unknownFunc() ‚Üí fallback()
 * 
 * BEST PRACTICES:
 * 
 * 1. Keep these functions simple
 * 2. Use events for monitoring
 * 3. Consider gas limitations
 * 4. Handle errors appropriately
 * 5. Document expected behavior
